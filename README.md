# SistemaSolar
I have always been passionate about the universe and the vastness of space.
This is a simple and personal project in which I implemented some classes to represent planets and their orbits.
I used the edu.princeton.cs.algs4.Draw package to create a visual simulation of a solar system, with planets rotating around the sun.
